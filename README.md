# EECS595_Final_Project
This is code for our EECS595_Final_Project: Dual Multi-head Co-Attention For Abstract Meaning Reading Comprehension. We work on SemEval-2021 shared task 4, whic h requires the participating system to fill in the the correct answer from five candidates of abstract concepts in a cloze-style to replace the @Placeholder in the question. We apply DUal Multi-head Co-Attention (DUMA) model on top of ELECTRA encoder to classify the options. As a result, we get 89.95% for subtask1, 91.41% for subtask2 and 90.59% for subtask3.
